# SpringBoot Repository

This repository is designed for study purposes to learn how to use **Spring Boot**. The goal of this project is to build a **functional backend** that can be used in an **Angular project**. This backend includes all the necessary configurations to set up a Spring Boot application, including RESTful APIs and database integrations.

By the end of this project, we should have a fully functional backend to connect with an Angular front-end, enabling us to build and deploy full-stack web applications.

## Features

- **REST API**: Designed to interact with front-end applications via HTTP requests.
- **Database integration**:Has configurations for connecting to external databases.
